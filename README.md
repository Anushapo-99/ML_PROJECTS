ADULT INCOME PREDICTION USING CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES

Adult income dataset was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database, which consists of 48,842 rows and 15 columns obtained from the same 1994 US Census database.
The project aimed to develop a model that predicts whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually based on various demographic and socio-economic features. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training, created a predictive model with satisfactory performance. The key factors influencing income included education level, occupation, workclass, age, and marital status. The selected machine learning models(such as Knn,NaiveBayes,Svm,Random Forest,Decision Tree)demonstrated promising performance, as evidenced by its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test dataset. Analyzing different classification techniques and considering their respective accuracies, it can be inferred that all the models demonstrated accuracies within the range of 83% to 88%. After hyper_parameter_tuning a slight change in accuracy occure only in Knn,Naive Bayes,Svm model. Accuracy of all other models remains the same. Notably,Random forest classifier exhibited a slightly higher accuracy of 88%.
